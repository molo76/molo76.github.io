<div class="blurb">
        		<h1>Hi there, forget me not.</h1>
				<p>I tend to be forgetful. What was that command again? How did I do that thing I did a year ago? I'm putting stuff here that I want to remember for later, mostly:
        <ul>
         <li>Linux sysadmin stuff</li>
         <li>Networking commands</li>
         <li>Python bits</li>
         <li>Anything else that uses a command line</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
<p>Although, the real driver for this website is to help me learn <a href="https://github.com/">git</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, and some <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jykell</a>.</p>
