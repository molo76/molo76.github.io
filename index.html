<div class="blurb">
        		<h1>Hi there, forget me not!</h1>
				<br/>
				<p>I tend to be forgetful...'What was that command again?'....'How did I do that thing I did a year ago?'. I'm putting stuff here that I want to remember for later, or find interesting into the blog section. A bit more about me, if you're at all interested is...<a href="/about">here</a></p>
<p>Although, the real driver for this website is to help me learn git, jykell, python & flask!</p>
