        		<h1>Hi there, forget me not.</h1>
				<p>I tend to be forgetful. What was that command again? How did I do that thing I did a year ago? I'm putting stuff here that I want to remember for later.</p>
<p>Although, the real driver for this website is to help me learn git, python, flask, and some jykell!</p>
