Amazing that this is the first post in 5 years. I started this blog off originally during a period at work where I was really bored with the day to day work and I wanted to learn something new. Github was new to me, and this blog enabled me to learn GitHub skills and Jekyll along the way. Jekyll excited me because I've run Wordpress sites in the past, and currently host my own [Ghost](https://octanespring.co.uk) install, which required MySQL, NodeJS & it's own cloud instance. Great for learning and tinkering with those things, but not very lightweight. 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on the otherhand is nice and lightweight, and can be hosted right here on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Equally cool is that Jekyll blog posts are just simple Markdown pages. I'm a **big** fan of Markdown and use [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) to quickly knock out MD files. 

Coming back to the revival of this blog. 5 years ago I moved job (partly due to the boredom) and found myself swamped with really interesting work. I quickly learnt Terraform [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Salt](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/getstarted/) and spent the next 4 years in [Azure](http://Azure.microsoft.com). I went from a job which was 100% Cisco engineer focused to being a Principle DevOps Engineer, embracing Infrastructure As Code, Kubernetes, Automation and a whole bunch of new tools and processes. In that time I was so busy this blog just got forgotten about. 

Now I want my GitHub contributions to look better, so thought I'd revive this blog! ![]({{ site.url }}/assets/ghcontributions.png)

Not really....the recent contributions you can see in the contributions map above are due to a(nother) Python course I am currently doing, and the course has really motivated me to get going again. Not least because I'm doing alot of AWS Boto3 work right now too. 

I'll post up some Boto3 examples I am working on soon, that seems like a good place to start adding new content.
