Here we are. First post following this great [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone on how to create a [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as the static site framework.

Jekyll uses Markdown syntax, here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Things on the to-do list with this site, now it's up:
* Add a jekyll [theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/)
* Set up jekyll locally to test changes without committing to github every 5 minutes!
* Add an image (it's still early days)
* Add some more blog posts, obviously!
