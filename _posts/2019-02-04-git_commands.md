Git is an great tool. I come from a world of Ops, Infrastructure and Networks, development is something I have toyed with many times but never worked with in a real world/work scenario, until now. I've been using it alot in the past year, and look to be doing more with it daily. 

I was going to create my own page of git commands, however I found this page instead, and it does the job far better than I could: [Roger Dudler's git-guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). The page is excellent, the PDF cheat sheet on that page is even better.
