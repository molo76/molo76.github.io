<p>This site is a blog site to mostly keep notes of things I forget, usually commands and bits n pieces of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Linux sysadmin stuff</li>
 <li>Networking commands</li>
 <li>Python</li>
 <li>Anything else that uses a command line</li>
</ul>
<p>
About me though? I work as a network engineer, CCNP R&S since 2013. Have had various network/sysadmin jobs since 1999. I've been a big fan of Linux since I stumbled on RedHat 6.2 in 1999. Fedora is my go-to distro, but familiar with Debian/SuSE/Arch and others. I have an awesome wife, and a amazing son. Love music, play the drums in a <a href="http://www.octanspring.co.uk">rock covers band</a>, bedroom DJ drum & bass, play blues on the guitar and love being outside. Currently trying to learn more python, hence the github stuff and this site.</p>
