I work as a network engineer. I've been a big fan of Linux since I stumbled on RedHat 6.2 in 1999. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> is my go-to distro, and I love <a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">Gnome3</a>. I have an awesome wife, and an amazing son. I love music, play the drums in a <a href="http://www.octanespring.co.uk">rock covers band (and also run their website on Ghost/NodeJS in AWS)</a>, bedroom DJ drum & bass, play blues on the guitar and love being outside. Currently trying to learn more python, hence the github stuff and this site.</p>
