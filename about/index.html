I currently work as a Principle Cloud Network Engineer. I've been a big fan of Linux since I stumbled on RedHat 6.2 in 1999. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> is my go-to distro, and I love <a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">Gnome3</a>, although since I worked at Rackspace back in 2013 I have become a Mac lover for work. Through recent jobs I have spent 4 years deep in DevOps in Azure with Ansible/Salt, AzureDevOps, AKS, BitBucket. My current gig is totally AWS based, EKS and boto3.

I host a few websites (Ghost/NodeJS/MySQL/Apache/Linux on GCP), am a bedroom DJ spinning old crusty drum & bass vinyl, play the drums in a couple of bands and blues on the guitar. Generally love being outside. Currently trying to learn more python, hence the github stuff and this site.</p>
