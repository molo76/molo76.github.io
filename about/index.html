<div class="blurb">
<p>This site is a blog site to mostly keep notes of things I forget, usually commands and bits n pieces of:
<ul>
 <li>Linux sysadmin stuff</li>
 <li>Networking commands</li>
 <li>Python</li>
 <li>Anything else that uses a command line</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>About me though, I work as a network engineer, CCNP R&S and have been a big fan of Linux since I stumbled on RedHat 6.2 in 1999. Have had various network/sysadmin jobs since 1999. Fedora is my go-to distro. I am husband and a dad. Love music, play the drums in a band, bedroom DJ drum & bass, play blues on the guitar and love being outside. Currently trying to learn more python, hence the github stuff and this site.
